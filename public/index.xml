      <description>After reading James Vaughan&amp;rsquo;s write-up about what he could do with a connection to the flightâ€™s WiFi without access to the internet, and an upcoming Southwest flight of my own, I&amp;rsquo;d thought I&amp;rsquo;d replicate his findings and see what else was lurking around the airlines&amp;rsquo; network.
First, the data collection:
while true; do http getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json | jq &amp;gt; current_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M).json; sleep 60; done I started this maybe 30 minutes into my flight so wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get the full duration, but at the end the data checks out!</description>
